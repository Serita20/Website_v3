# About Us

We are a collection of biostatisticians and students working on various topics in the [Division of Epidemiology & Biostatistics](http://www.publichealth.uct.ac.za/phfm_epidemiology-and-biostatistics), School of Public Health & Family Medicine at the University of Cape Town. Current research themes are around viral load monitoring and all of the associated statistical modelling of difficult longitudinal data.



We work with the [Cape-R Users Group](https://caperuser.wordpress.com/) to promote R programming around the Cape and wider afield, please join if you are local to Cape Town - twitter: [CapeRUser](https://twitter.com/CapeRUser/) 

We also run a regular statistical methods seminar series on the Health Sciences Faculty â€“ announced on web and via twitter:  [EpiBiostats_UCT](https://twitter.com/EpiBiostats_UCT/)
